# Heart_attack Percentage Prediction By Using Neural Network
python, neural network 

This project involved using a neural network to predict a person's risk of experiencing a heart attack based on a set of features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and family history of heart disease. The data was preprocessed and a neural network was designed and trained using an appropriate architecture, loss function, and optimization algorithm. The trained neural network was able to predict a person's heart attack risk factor with a certain level of
accuracy.
